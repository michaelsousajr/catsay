Catsay Bash Script
This is a simple Bash script that displays a "cat saying" ASCII art along with a message input by the user.

Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script by typing the following command: ./catsay.sh
Enter a message when prompted by the script.
The script will display a "cat saying" ASCII art along with the message you entered.
Functionality
The catsay function is defined in the script, which takes a message as an argument and displays it along with a "cat saying" ASCII art. The function uses the following components:

Two blank lines to separate the output from previous text in the terminal.
A horizontal line made of dashes to create a border above and below the message.
The message itself, which is passed to the function as an argument.
A backslash and a forward slash to create the "cat's body".
A series of slashes and backslashes to create the "cat's legs" and "tail".
An ASCII art representation of the "cat's head" and "face", made up of various punctuation characters.
The read command is used to prompt the user for input and store the message in the msg variable. The catsay function is then called with the msg variable as an argument to display the output.
